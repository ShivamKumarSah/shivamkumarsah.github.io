# ðŸš€ My Portfolio â€“ Built with Next.js, Tailwind, and Aceternity UI  

I started this project as a way to blend **modern design trends** with **scalable full-stack development**.  
Inspired by clean UI patterns and immersive interactions, I wanted to build a portfolio that doesnâ€™t just showcase my work but also reflects the way I approach software engineering â€” **structured, creative, and performance-driven**.  

With **Next.js**, I ensured smooth routing and static export for deployment.  
With **TailwindCSS**, I built a fully responsive, minimal yet elegant design system.  
And with **Aceternity UI**, I added subtle animations and components that make the experience truly interactive.
